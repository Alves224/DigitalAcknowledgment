## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using LocalStorage:

- **Acknowledgment Types**: Custom types you create
- **Submissions**: All acknowledgment submissions
- **Theme Preference**: Your selected theme (light/dark)

### Data Persistence

- Data persists between browser sessions
- Data is specific to the browser and domain
- Clear browser data will remove all stored information

### Data Export/Backup

- Individual acknowledgments can be exported as PDF
- Use `exportData()` in browser console for full data backup
- Use `debugApp()` in browser console for application diagnostics

## Browser Compatibility

**Supported Browsers:**

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

**Required Features:**

- ES6+ JavaScript support
- LocalStorage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- SVG support

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used

- **jsPDF**: For PDF generation (loaded from CDN)
- **Pure JavaScript**: No frameworks or build dependencies
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For theming and design system
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For responsive layouts

### Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with separate concerns:

- **Storage Module**: Handles all LocalStorage operations
- **Data Module**: Manages acknowledgment types and business logic
- **UI Module**: Handles interface updates and modal management
- **Forms Module**: Manages form state and validation
- **Theme Module**: Handles dark/light mode switching
- **PDF Module**: Generates and exports PDF documents
- **Main Module**: Coordinates all modules and handles initialization

### Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight**: Total size under 100KB (excluding external PDF library)
- **Fast Loading**: No build process or bundling required
- **Efficient**: Minimal DOM manipulation and event delegation
- **Memory Conscious**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection

## Customization

### Styling

Edit `css/styles.css` to customize:

- Colors and themes
- Component sizes and spacing
- Responsive breakpoints
- Animation timing

### Content

Edit `js/data.js` to customize:

- Default acknowledgment types
- Default content and rules
- Icon mappings

### Functionality

Extend functionality by modifying the respective modules:

- Add new form fields in `js/forms.js`
- Add new export formats in `js/pdf.js`
- Add new UI components in `js/ui.js`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Export Not Working**

   - Ensure jsPDF library loads from CDN
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify browser supports PDF generation

2. **Data Not Persisting**

   - Check if LocalStorage is enabled in browser
   - Verify you're not in private/incognito mode
   - Clear browser cache and reload

3. **Theme Not Switching**

   - Verify CSS custom properties are supported
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

4. **Responsive Issues**
   - Ensure browser supports CSS Grid and Flexbox
   - Check viewport meta tag is present
   - Verify browser window width

### Debug Commands

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
debugApp(); // Application diagnostics
exportData(); // Export all data as backup
```

## Limitations

Compared to the original React version:

1. **No Real-time Sync**: Data is only local, no server synchronization
2. **No Advanced Validation**: Basic client-side validation only
3. **No User Authentication**: No user management or permissions
4. **No Server Integration**: Cannot connect to backend services
5. **Browser Dependent**: Data tied to specific browser instance

## Migration from React Version

If migrating from the React version:

1. **Data Export**: Export any existing data from the React version
2. **Manual Import**: Copy acknowledgment types and submissions manually
3. **Theme Settings**: Reselect your preferred theme
4. **Verification**: Test all functionality works as expected

## Contributing

To contribute to this standalone version:

1. Test thoroughly in multiple browsers
2. Maintain vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
3. Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
4. Update documentation for any new features
5. Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes

## License

This standalone version maintains the same license as the original React project.
