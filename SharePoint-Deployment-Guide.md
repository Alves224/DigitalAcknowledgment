## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### File Modifications Needed:

1. **Inline All CSS and JavaScript** ‚úÖ
   - Created `sharepoint-deployment.html` with inline styles
   - Avoids SharePoint path resolution issues

2. **LocalStorage Considerations**
   - SharePoint may have restrictions on localStorage
   - Consider using SharePoint Lists for data persistence

3. **PDF Export**
   - Test PDF generation in SharePoint environment
   - May need CDN links for jsPDF library

4. **Security Settings**
   - Ensure SharePoint allows custom scripts
   - Check Content Security Policy (CSP) settings

## üîß SharePoint-Specific Configurations

### 1. Enable Custom Scripts (If Required)
```powershell
# PowerShell command for SharePoint Admin
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/[sitename] -DenyAddAndCustomizePages $false
```

### 2. Alternative: Use SharePoint Lists for Data Storage
Instead of localStorage, consider:
- Creating SharePoint Lists for acknowledgment data
- Using SharePoint REST API or PnP JS for data operations
- Better integration with SharePoint permissions

### 3. CDN Links for External Libraries
For better performance, use CDN links:
```html
<!-- jsPDF from CDN -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### 1. SharePoint Limitations
- **Script restrictions**: Some SharePoint tenants restrict custom JavaScript

### 2. Browser Compatibility
- Test in Edge (primary SharePoint browser)
- Ensure compatibility with IE11 if still required
- Test mobile responsiveness in SharePoint mobile app

### 3. Permissions
- Ensure users have appropriate permissions to the document library
- Test with different permission levels (Read, Contribute, Full Control)

### 4. Performance
- Large inline CSS/JS may impact page load times
- Consider splitting into multiple files if needed
- Monitor SharePoint page performance metrics

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Scripts not loading**
   - Check if custom scripts are enabled
   - Verify Content Security Policy settings
   - Use browser developer tools to check for errors

2. **Styles not applying**
   - Ensure CSS is properly inlined
   - Check for SharePoint CSS conflicts
   - Add `!important` to critical styles if needed

3. **localStorage not working**
   - SharePoint may restrict localStorage
   - Implement fallback to SharePoint Lists
   - Test in different browsers

4. **PDF export failing**

   - Verify jsPDF is loaded correctly
   - Test with different PDF content
