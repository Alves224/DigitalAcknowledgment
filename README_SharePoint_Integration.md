# YSOD Digital Acknowledgment Form Hub - SharePoint Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the SharePoint integration features implemented in the YSOD Digital Acknowledgment Form Hub. The integration transforms the application from a localStorage-based system to a SharePoint-powered solution with enhanced security and administrative controls.

## New Features

### 1. **Admin/Employee Role Detection**
- **Old Behavior**: Manual dropdown selection for roles
- **New Behavior**: Auto-detected via SharePoint admin list
- **Implementation**: 
  - Creates and manages `AcknowledgmentAdmins` SharePoint list
  - Automatically checks current user against admin list
  - Restricts admin functions based on SharePoint permissions

### 2. **Employee Name Auto-Fill**
- **Old Behavior**: Manually entered employee names
- **New Behavior**: Auto-filled from SharePoint user profile
- **Implementation**:
  - Fetches current user information from SharePoint API
  - Pre-populates employee name field in acknowledgment forms
  - Uses SharePoint user's display name (`Title` property)

### 3. **Admin-Only Add/Delete Acknowledgments**
- **Old Behavior**: Anyone with role access could add/delete
- **New Behavior**: Only users in SharePoint admin list can add/delete
- **Implementation**:
  - Hides "Add New Acknowledgment Type" button for non-admins
  - Shows delete buttons only for admins on custom acknowledgment types
  - Server-side validation through SharePoint permissions

### 4. **SharePoint List Storage**
- **Old Behavior**: All data stored in localStorage
- **New Behavior**: Submissions stored in configurable SharePoint Lists
- **Implementation**:
  - Default list: `AcknowledgmentSubmissions`
  - Admin-configurable list selection
  - Automatic list creation with proper schema
  - Fallback to localStorage when SharePoint unavailable

### 5. **Admin List Selection Panel**
- **Old Behavior**: Not available
- **New Behavior**: Admins can choose/create SharePoint Lists for submissions
- **Implementation**:
  - Admin panel for list management
  - Create new lists with proper fields
  - Switch between existing lists
  - Real-time list availability checking

## Technical Implementation

### SharePoint Service (`js/sharepoint.js`)
- **Authentication**: Uses SharePoint REST API with current user context
- **List Management**: Automated creation and field configuration
- **Admin Checking**: Query-based permission validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to localStorage

### Storage Layer (`js/storage.js`)
- **Hybrid Approach**: SharePoint primary, localStorage fallback
- **Async Operations**: All storage operations now async-compatible
- **Data Sync**: Automatic migration from localStorage to SharePoint
- **List Selection**: Admin-configurable submission storage

### UI Enhancements (`js/ui.js`)
- **Role-Based UI**: Dynamic hide/show based on admin status
- **Auto-Fill**: Employee name pre-population
- **Status Indicators**: SharePoint connection status display
- **Admin Controls**: Additional UI elements for administrative functions

### Admin Panel (`js/main.js`)
- **List Management**: Create/select SharePoint lists
- **User Management**: Add/remove admin users
- **Data Operations**: Sync, export, and management tools
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time SharePoint connection status

## Configuration
