# SharePoint Integration Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing strategies for your SharePoint-integrated acknowledgment system, from development to production deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Immediate Mock Testing (Fastest)**
```bash
# Open the test page directly in browser
open test.html
# or double-click test.html
```

### 2. **Local Development Server Testing**
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Then open: http://localhost:8000/test.html
```

### 3. **Automated Testing**
```bash
# Run automated file structure and code quality tests
node test-automation.js

# View results
cat test-report.json
```

## 📊 Testing Environments

### Environment 1: Mock SharePoint (Development)
**Best for:** Initial development, UI testing, feature development

**Features:**
- ✅ No SharePoint setup required
- ✅ Switch between different user roles instantly
- ✅ Simulate all SharePoint operations
- ✅ Test error scenarios
- ✅ Fast iteration and debugging

**How to use:**
1. Open `test.html` in any browser
2. The system automatically uses mock mode
3. Use the test controls panel to switch users and test scenarios

### Environment 2: SharePoint Online Developer Tenant
**Best for:** Real SharePoint API testing, authentication flows

**Setup:**
1. Sign up for [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program)
2. Get a free developer tenant
3. Create test SharePoint site
4. Upload your files to SharePoint document library
5. Access via SharePoint site URL

**Benefits:**
- Real SharePoint REST API
- Actual authentication
- Real permissions and security
- Production-like environment

### Environment 3: SharePoint On-Premises
**Best for:** Enterprise environments, on-premises testing

**Requirements:**
- SharePoint Server access
- Development environment setup
- Network access to SharePoint server

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### A. User Role Testing

#### Admin User Testing:
```javascript
// In test.html, switch to admin user and test:
1. Create acknowledgment types ✅
2. Delete acknowledgment types ✅  
3. Manage SharePoint lists ✅
4. View all submissions ✅
```

#### Employee User Testing:
```javascript
// Switch to employee user and verify:
1. Cannot create acknowledgment types ❌
2. Cannot delete acknowledgment types ❌
3. Can only submit acknowledgments ✅
4. Name auto-filled from SharePoint ✅
```

### B. SharePoint Integration Testing

#### List Operations:
```javascript
// Test in test.html
1. Get admin staff list → Should return admin emails
2. Create new acknowledgment lists → Should create SharePoint lists
3. Add acknowledgment submissions → Should store in SharePoint
4. Search functionality → Should query SharePoint lists
```

#### Authentication Testing:
```javascript
// Test user detection
1. Current user retrieval → Should get SharePoint user info
2. Admin status check → Should check against admin list
3. Permission validation → Should enforce role-based access
```

### C. Data Flow Testing

#### Acknowledgment Submission Flow:
```
1. User opens acknowledgment form
2. Name auto-populated from SharePoint ✅
3. User fills form and submits
4. Data stored in appropriate SharePoint list ✅
5. Admin can view submission in SharePoint ✅
```

#### Admin Management Flow:
```
1. Admin creates new acknowledgment type
2. System prompts for SharePoint list name
3. SharePoint list created automatically ✅
4. Employees can submit to new type ✅
```

### Mock Data Features
```javascript
// Pre-configured test users
Admin Users:
- admin@company.com (John Admin)
- manager@company.com (Sarah Manager)

Employee Users:
- employee1@company.com (Mike Employee)
- employee2@company.com (Lisa Worker)
- test@company.com (Test User)

// Pre-configured lists

- SafetyAcknowledgments (for safety submissions)
- TrainingAcknowledgments (for training submissions)
```

## 🚀 Testing Workflows

### Daily Development Testing
```bash
1. Open test.html
2. Run "Test Connection" to verify mock service
3. Switch between admin and employee users
4. Test specific feature you're developing
5. Use console log to debug issues
```

### Pre-deployment Testing
```bash
1. Run automated tests: node test-automation.js
2. Test in SharePoint Online developer tenant
3. Verify all user scenarios work
4. Test error handling and edge cases
5. Performance testing with mock service
```

### Production Readiness Testing
```bash
1. Deploy to actual SharePoint environment
2. Create admin staff list with real emails
3. Test with real user accounts
4. Verify permissions and security
5. Load testing with multiple users
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "SharePoint not detected"
**Solution:**
- Check if you're in a SharePoint environment
- Use "Force Mock Mode" for development
- Verify SharePoint site permissions

#### Issue: "User not found in admin list"
**Solution:**
- Check admin staff list in SharePoint
- Verify email addresses match exactly
- Ensure list permissions allow reading

#### Issue: "Cannot create lists"
**Solution:**
- Verify SharePoint permissions for list creation
- Check if user has site owner/designer rights
- Test with mock mode first

#### Issue: "Authentication errors"
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're logged into SharePoint
- Check if site allows REST API access
- Verify CORS settings if needed

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console
debugApp(); // Show application diagnostics
window.SharePointService.getEnvironmentInfo(); // Environment details
window.SharePointMock.getTestSummary(); // Mock service status
```

## 📈 Performance Testing

### Mock Service Performance
The mock service should handle:
- 100+ operations per second
- < 10ms average response time
- < 50MB memory usage

### Real SharePoint Performance
Expected performance with SharePoint:
- 2-5 second initial load
- 200-500ms per API call
- Dependent on network and SharePoint server

## 🔒 Security Testing

### Test Security Scenarios
1. **Unauthorized Access**: Verify non-admin users cannot access admin functions
2. **Data Validation**: Test with malicious input data
3. **Permission Escalation**: Ensure employees cannot gain admin rights
4. **XSS Prevention**: Test script injection in form fields

### Security Checklist
- ✅ User roles properly enforced
- ✅ Input sanitization working
- ✅ SharePoint permissions respected
- ✅ No sensitive data in client-side code
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage

3. **Run automated tests** with `node test-automation.js` for diagnosis
4. **Try mock mode** first to isolate SharePoint-specific issues
5. **Verify SharePoint permissions** if using real SharePoint environment

## 🎯 Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **Deploy to SharePoint**: Upload files to SharePoint document library
2. **Create Admin List**: Set up admin staff list with real email addresses
3. **Configure Permissions**: Set appropriate SharePoint permissions
4. **User Training**: Train admin staff on the new functionality
